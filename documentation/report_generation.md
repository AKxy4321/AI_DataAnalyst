### Report Generation Module Documentation

This module provides visualization capabilities for analyzing data by generating plots and charts based on clustering results, correlation matrices, and descriptive statistics. It leverages `matplotlib` and `seaborn` libraries to create visual summaries of the data.

---

#### Functions:

1. **`report(analysis_results: dict, original_data: pd.DataFrame)`**
   - **Description**:
     This function generates visual reports based on the analysis results, including clustering labels, cluster centers, correlation matrices, and descriptive statistics. It provides three types of visualizations:
     1. Scatter plot of clustering labels and centers, reduced to 2 dimensions if necessary using PCA.
     2. Heatmap of the correlation matrix to show the relationships between variables.
     3. Bar chart of descriptive statistics to summarize the dataset's key metrics.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `analysis_results (dict)`: A dictionary containing the results from the analysis engine. Expected keys:
       - `"Clustering Labels"`: Labels assigned to data points after clustering.
       - `"Cluster Centers"`: Coordinates of the cluster centers.
       - `"Correlation Matrix"`: Correlation matrix between numeric columns.
       - `"Descriptive Statistics"`: Descriptive statistics for the dataset.
     - `original_data (pd.DataFrame)`: The original DataFrame that was analyzed, containing both numeric and non-numeric data.
   - **Returns**:
     - None. The function generates and displays plots using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
   - **Usage Example**:
     ```python
     report(analysis_results=analysis_results, original_data=df)
     ```

### Visualization Steps:

1. **Scatter Plot of Clustering Labels and Centers**:
   - If the dataset has more than 2 numeric features, PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is used to reduce the dimensionality to 2 components for visualization purposes.
   - A scatter plot is then generated with data points colored according to their clustering labels, and the cluster centers are marked with red crosses.
   - **Libraries Used**: `matplotlib`, `sklearn.decomposition.PCA`
   - **Plot Example**:
     - **Title**: "Clustering Labels and Centers (PCA-reduced)"
     - **X-axis**: Principal Component 1
     - **Y-axis**: Principal Component 2

2. **Heatmap of the Correlation Matrix**:
   - A heatmap is generated to visualize the correlation between numeric columns in the dataset. This helps to identify relationships and potential dependencies between variables.
   - The correlation values are annotated in the heatmap, with a color scheme to indicate the strength of correlations.
   - **Libraries Used**: `seaborn`
   - **Plot Example**:
     - **Title**: "Correlation Matrix Heatmap"
     - **Color Scheme**: `coolwarm`
     - **Annotations**: Correlation coefficients

3. **Bar Chart of Descriptive Statistics**:
   - The descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for each numeric column are visualized in a bar chart. This gives an overview of the distribution and central tendency of the dataset.
   - **Libraries Used**: `matplotlib`
   - **Plot Example**:
     - **Title**: "Descriptive Statistics"
     - **X-axis**: Metrics (e.g., mean, std, min, max, etc.)
     - **Y-axis**: Values
     - **Rotation**: X-axis labels are rotated for better readability.

### Module Workflow:

1. **Input Data**:
   - The function takes the analysis results and original dataset as inputs.
   
2. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
   - If the dataset has more than 2 numeric features, PCA is used to reduce the data to 2 principal components for easier visualization.

3. **Scatter Plot**:
   - A scatter plot visualizes the clustering labels and centers.

4. **Correlation Heatmap**:
   - The correlation matrix is visualized through a heatmap to reveal the relationships between numeric features.

5. **Descriptive Statistics**:
   - A bar chart visualizes the descriptive statistics to provide insights into the dataset's distribution.

### Notes:

- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA is only applied when the dataset has more than 2 numeric features to simplify the scatter plot visualization. This helps in visualizing clusters in 2D space.
- **Heatmap**: The correlation heatmap provides a quick way to understand how variables are related, which can be useful for feature selection and data preprocessing.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: This visualization offers a comprehensive summary of the dataset, making it easier to interpret the spread and central tendencies of the data.
